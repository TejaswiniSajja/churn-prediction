# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict **customer churn** using machine learning. The model was built using Python in Jupyter Notebook, with a focus on identifying customers likely to discontinue service.

## 🗂️ Files Included

- `Churn_pred.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full implementation (EDA, model training & evaluation)
- `Churn_final_data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis and prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn significantly affects business revenue. Predicting churn helps companies take proactive steps to retain valuable customers. This project analyzes customer data and applies machine learning models to predict churn with high accuracy.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

## 🧠 ML Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled features.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualized trends and relationships using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

3. **Model Training & Testing**  
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   
4. **Evaluation**  
   Used metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to assess performance.

## 📈 Results

- Achieved high accuracy with Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers.
- Derived key insights about which features contribute most to churn.

## 📂 Dataset

- File: `Churn_final_data.csv`
- Description: Includes customer demographics, usage data, and churn labels.
- Size: ~X rows and Y columns *(you can fill this in after checking)*
